# Vehicle-Telematics-Data-Logger-and-Analysis-System

This project involves creating a system to collect, store, process, and analyze data from a simulated vehicle. The data could include metrics like speed, location, fuel efficiency, engine temperature, and more. You can then implement analysis features to generate insights or alerts based on the collected data.
